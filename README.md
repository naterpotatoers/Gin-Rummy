# Gin_Rummy
Class Assignment for Fall 2018. 

The assignment was designed to help us better understand 
stacks and queues through the boardgame Gin Rummy.

gin_rummy.h contains a lot of the game functionality 

main.cpp is the version that I submitted for my assignment.

main_full.cpp is the complete game with win condition checking using the bitset library.
This was not apart of the assignment. Nor was it extra credit
as I had thought previously.
