# Gin Rummy
Class Assignment for Fall 2018. Added win condition checking. 

The assignment was designed to help us better understand stacks and queues through the boardgame Gin Rummy.

gin_rummy.h and main.cpp contain just the basic game functionality without win condition checking.

### H3 main_full is the complete game.
I did this on my own outside of class using the bitset library. I mapped playing cards to a binary value and preformed BitWise operations to check for melds and runs. I realize that the initial build of the game lacks reusability so I am going to re-do the assignment with better design practice.
